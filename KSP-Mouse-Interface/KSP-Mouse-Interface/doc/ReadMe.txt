KSP Mouse Controller v0.4.0 by Bastian Heinrich & Vardaaran - A mod to control KSP completely with a mouse.

This mod adds a new control panel to KSP to control the active vessel with a mouse.
We hope to help handicapped people, who can't use a keyboard, to enjoy KSP a great game.

Features:
- Control of Yaw, Pitch, Roll, RCS, SAS, Throttle, Staging and ActionGroups with your mouse.
- Support of customized interfaces. Configurable with a xml file.
  Draw your own interface, create a hot spot graphic and adjust the KSPMouseInterface_Settings.xml in the Data folder.
  Ready is your interface! =) (send us your interface via mackerbal@mactee.de or post it in the forum)


Note:
- This is still a early version and under development!


Installation:
- Unzip to KSP install folder (Source folder isn't needed).

Short Story:
Vardaaran asked on the German Forum for a mouse controller mod, because he has to use a special mouse to control a computer.
He tried KSP with some on screen keyboards, which worked more or less but they where to uncomfortable.
He has designed the interface already, when he made a mod request in the forum. So i decided to help him out with the code side.
We hope to help other handicapped people to enjoy this great game!
